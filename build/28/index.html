            Chandan Tiwari, a local reporter with Hindi daily Aj in Jharkhand’s Chatra district, was abducted and badly beaten on October 29, 2018. Police said the reporter was found injured in a forest about 175 miles from Pathalgada, in Jharkhand.  He succumbed to his injuries the next day, according to NDTV. Jharkhand police identified four people–Maoist area commander Prasant, Pintu Singh, Jamuna Prasad, and Musafir Rana–as suspects who abducted and killed the journalist. Police arrested Prasant, Prasad, and Rana, but Singh remained free as of December 2018. The First Information Report filed by the police–which has been reviewed by CPJ–names all four suspects. Local reporters told CPJ that Maoists run a criminal network in the area, and that Singh is part of this network.
