        <h4> What&apos;s Maheshwar Pahari&apos;s story?</h4>
            Imprisoned reporter Pahari died after being denied proper medicaltreatment by authorities. Pahari, 30, who worked for the weekly Rastriya Swabhiman, diedof multiple illnesses in a hospital in Pokhara, 80 miles (130kilometers) northwest of Kathmandu, according to local journalistgroups. Local doctors had recommended Pahari be transferred toKathmandu for better treatment, and members of the Federation ofNepalese Journalists (FNJ) in Pokhara offered to pay to send him, theFNJ said. But officials refused, citing security concerns. He wasprovided treatment at the local hospital only after repeated appeals byhis wife, Durga Pahari, local journalists told CPJ.Pahari was detained by security forces in the village of Khorako Mukh,in western Nepal’s Kaski district on January 2, 2004. He was heldincommunicado for several months. Local journalists believe that hisdetention was linked to his journalistic work. Pahari maintained closecontacts in the Maoist rebel movement, and some sources told CPJ thatsecurity forces might have detained him to gather information about theleadership of the insurgency against King Gyanendra.Pahari was held under an anti-terrorism law that has been used to jailjournalists since it was introduced in November 2001. Authoritiesreleased and re-arrested him four times after January 2004 in order tocomply with that law, which limits detention without trial to sixmonths. In May, he was released from a Kaski jail and arrested beforehe could leave the compound, local human rights and media advocacygroups reported.
