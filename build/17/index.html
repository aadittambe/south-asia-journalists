Seven other journalists were injured.The first, small blast went off at a market, drawing a largecrowd that included journalists covering the story, according to news reportsand local journalists. A second, larger explosion, apparently a suicide bomb,went off after the crowd had grown.The attack took place near the city center, in an area wheremilitary facilities are concentrated and where many major Pakistani mediaorganizations have their offices.
