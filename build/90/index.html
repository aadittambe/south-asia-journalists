            No one claimed responsibility for the killing of Khankhel,who died in the first violation of a truce called two days earlier between thegovernment and local militant groups, according to local and international newsreports. Khankhel was targeted while covering a peace march led by Muslimcleric Sufi Muhammad, father-in-law of local Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah,the reports said. Muhammad was seeking to recruit his son-in-law to join acease-fire agreement he had negotiated with the government. Geo Managing Director Azhar Abbas told CPJ that Khankhel hadbecome separated from the rest of his four-person reporting team in amilitant-controlled area near the town of Matta. He suffered multiple gunshotwounds to the torso and back of the head, Abbas said. A BBC report citingKhankhel’s brother said the journalist had been abducted at gunpoint from thepeace march, and that his hands and feet were bound when his body wasdiscovered.
