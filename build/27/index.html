At least 50 people were injured during the demonstration, including nine who were shot, according to that report. CPJ could not determine who fired the shots that killed Muzakkir.On February 23, Muzakkir’s father, Nurul Huda Master, filed a police murder case over the journalist’s killing, according to news reports, which said that the case did not name any assailants, and that police had opened an investigation.CPJ emailed the Bangladeshi police for comment but did not receive any response.Barta Bazar did not immediately reply to CPJ’s request for comment via messaging app. CPJ was unable to find contact information for Bangladesh Samachar.
