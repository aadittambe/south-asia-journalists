            Shafi, a reporter for Doordarshan TV, the official Indian television network, for “Kashmir File,” a weekly news program, and “Eyewitness,” a five-minute nightly news capsule, was fatally shot in an ambush by two gunmen in Srinagar, Kashmir. His personal security guard also was killed in the attack. “Kashmir File” criticized militant Kashmiri separatists in the state, and Shafi told colleagues that he had received threats from separatists for what they said was his “biased” reporting.
