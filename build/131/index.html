        <h4> What&apos;s <span>Saleem Shahzad&apos;s</span> story?</h4>
            Shahzad, 40, vanished on May 29 after writing about allegedlinks between Al-Qaeda and the Pakistani Navy. His body was found on May 31 ina canal near the town of Mandi Bahauddin, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southof the capital, Islamabad. His friends said the body showed signs of torturearound the face and neck. He had told colleagues that he had been receivingthreats from intelligence officials in recent months.Shahzad was reported missing after he failed to show up fora televised panel discussion in Islamabad. He was scheduled to discuss hisrecent article for Asia Times Online in which he reported that Al-Qaeda, havinginfiltrated the Pakistani Navy, was behind a 17-hour siege at a naval base inKarachi on May 22. He said the attack came after military or security officialsrefused to release a group of naval officials suspected of being linked tomilitant groups. The attack, coming soon after the U.S. killing of Osama binLaden on May 2, was deeply embarrassing to the Pakistani military. Earlier inMay, three navy buses carrying recruits were blown up via remote controldevices in Karachi, the large port city where the navy has its headquarters. Shahzad’s death also came a few days after the release ofhis book, Inside the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. For months, the journalist had been telling friends that hehad been warned by intelligence agents to stop reporting on sensitive securitymatters. In October 2010, Shahzad told Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher for HumanRights Watch in Pakistan, that he had been threatened by a top official at ameeting at the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate inRawalpindi. Hasan said Shahzad sent him a note describing the meeting“in case something happens to me or my family in the future,” Human RightsWatch reported. Hameed Haroon, president of the All Pakistan Newspapers Societyand a former employer of Shahzad, said he had received a similar message atabout the same time. In July 2011, The New York Times reported that U.S.officials had reliable intelligence that showed that the ISI was responsiblefor Shahzad’s murder. Pakistan’s official commission of inquiry concluded inJanuary 2012 that the perpetrators were unknown, a finding that was widelycriticized as lacking credibility.
