            Singh, 36, a senior correspondent for the daily Indian Express, died of injuries suffered in a July 12 bombing.

The blast killed one other person and injured several others, including Gupta.Indian media outlets reported that police in Uttar Pradesh had arrested two members of the local Samajwadi Party in the attack.
