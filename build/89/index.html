An uncle and colleagueof Sangi had recently been attacked in connection with the station’s reportsthat two children had been punished by the tribal court, the journalist unionsaid.Mazhar Abbas, then the secretary-general of the journalistunion, said Sangi’s body was not recovered for several hours after he was shot.Journalists in Larkana staged a sit-in to protest the killing of theircolleague.The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan saidSangi had received threats in connection with his coverage of alleged abuses byAltaf Hussain Unar, a provincial minister. The Sindh Home Department said thatfour people were arrested after Sangi’s death and that three police officialswere suspended.
