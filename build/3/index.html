            Unidentified assailants shot Haq as he was leaving the KhuzdarPress Club in the city of Khuzdar in Baluchistan province. Haq was thesecretary-general of the press club and a longtime local correspondent for ARYTelevision. ARY Television said it was not aware of any threats directedat Haq. But Hamid Mir, a prominent Pakistani journalist, wrote after Haq’sdeath that the journalist had been threatened by the Baluch Musalah Diffa Army(BMDA, or the Armed Baluch Defense) in November 2011 and had subsequently beennamed on a hit list issued by a BMDA spokesman.Tensions with the press had escalated after the BaluchistanHigh Court barred news coverage of banned groups in October 2011. Several ofthe banned groups began threatening local journalists for not reporting ontheir militant operations.Haq’s family declined to discuss widespread assertions byhis colleagues that he had been killed because security forces were angry thathe was working with the families of missing Baluchis on presenting cases beforethe Quetta bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. At the time of Haq’s death,the court was hearing more than 100 missing-person cases in Baluchistan. Ofthose cases, 19 were from Khuzdar.
