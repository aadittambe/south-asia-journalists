        <h4> What&apos;s Rashmi Mohamed&apos;s story?</h4>
            Mohamed, a provincial correspondent for Sirasa TV, wascovering the opening ceremony of the new office of the United National Party(UNP) in Anuradhapurawhen a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device. The blast apparently came from a member of the LiberationTigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) inside the newly opened and crowded office of theopposition UNP. The target appeared to be retired Maj. Gen. Janaka Perera, whodied in the blast. At least 27 people died, and at least 80 more were wounded inthe explosion.Security was apparently lax at the event. UNP officialsquoted by The Associated Press accused the government of ignoring repeatedrequests for a stronger security detail for Perera, who was a vocal critic ofthe way the government had conducted its military campaign against the LTTEsecessionists. “The government must take full responsibility. They did not givehim adequate security for political reasons,” AP quoted party officialTissa Attanayake as saying.
