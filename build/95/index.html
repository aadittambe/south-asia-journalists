        <h4> What&apos;s <span>Nahar Ali&apos;s</span> story?</h4>
            Ali, a correspondent for the Khulna-based, Bengali-language daily Anirban,died shortly before midnight on April 21, while undergoing treatment atKhulna Medical College Hospital for injuries sustained in an attackdays earlier. Late on the night of April 17, masked men kidnapped Alifrom his home in the village of Shovna, according to local pressreports. The assailants stabbed him, beat him severely, and broke hishands and legs before abandoning him on the outskirts of his village,according to police.Ali was found unconscious and taken to the hospital in Khulna, a majorcity in southwestern Bangladesh. Doctors said he died due to majorbrain damage and profuse bleeding.Police suggested that members of the outlawed Biplobi Communist Partymay have killed Ali because of a dispute over ownership of a shrimpfarm. However, journalists in Khulna said that the investigation lackedcredibility because Ali’s reporting had uncovered links between policeand smuggling rings in the region. CPJ sources said that Ali, whoworked as the Dumuria subdistrict correspondent for Anirban,was killed because “he knew too much” about the workings of localcriminal syndicates and the complicity of some local authorities intheir activities.
