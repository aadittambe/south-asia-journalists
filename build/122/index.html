        <h4> What&apos;s <span>Relangi Selvarajah&apos;s</span> story?</h4>
            Popular Tamil broadcaster Relangi Selvarajah and her husband, apolitical activist, were killed by unidentified gunmen in Colombo onthe same day that Lakshman Kadirgamar, Sri Lanka’s foreign minister,was assassinated. Political leaders blamed the rebel Liberation Tigersof Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for all three killings, charges the LTTE denied.			  The attackers shot Selvarajah, 44, and her husband, Senathurai, in the office where they ran a travel agency. Sri Lanka’s Sunday Times reported that the LTTE had criticized Selvarajah for broadcasting anti-LTTE programs.Selvarajah was a radio and television host for 20 years, presentingnews programs for the state-run Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation(SLBC) and more recently for the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corp., accordingto the Free Media Movement, a local press freedom organization.Local newspapers reported that Selvarajah also produced the SLBCprogram “Ithaya Veenai,” a program known for criticizing the LTTE, andallegedly funded by the opposition Tamil political party, the EelamPeople’s Democratic Party.Selvarajah’s husband was affiliated with the formerly militant and nowmainstream group, the People’s Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam(PLOTE), according to local news reports and sources. PLOTE is criticalof the LTTE; the LTTE accuses PLOTE of attacking its members, accordingto The Associated Press.			  Sri Lanka’s Daily Mirror quotedpolice as saying that they suspected the couple may have been murderedbecause of Selvarajah’s anti-LTTE programs. But their connection toPLOTE also raised the possibility that their killing may have been partof a larger cycle of violence and could be connected to the Aprilmurder of well-known pro-LTTE Tamil journalist Dharmeratnam Sivaram,local sources told CPJ. Sivaram was a former member of PLOTE whodefected to the LTTE. Political and ethnic factionsbegan a series of revenge killings across the country last year when aTamil rebel leader known as Colonel Karuna split from the LTTE.The government declared a state of emergency on August 13 and PresidentChandrika Kumaratunga accused the LTTE of killing Kadirgamar, a criticof the LTTE.
