        <h1>Mapping every journalist <span>killed</span> in South Asia <br>since 1992</h1>
        <h3 class = byline>By Aadit Tambe</h3>
        <hr>

        <p class="update">Data current as of Oct. 24, 2021</p>

        <p><span>167 journalists </span> have been killed in South Asian countries &mdash; which include Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives &mdash; since 1992, according to the <a href="https://cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>.</p>
        <p>CPJ’s 2020 Global Impunity Index spotlights countries where journalists are singled out for murder and their killers go free, showed that three out of the top 12 countries &mdash; Bangladesh, India and Pakistan  &mdash; are located in South Asia.</p>

        <p>Curruption, weak institutions, and lack of political will to pursue robust investigations were factors behind impunity in most countries on the list. Some cases that were thought to be resolved were upended. Last year, Pakistan's Sindh High Court overturned the murder convictions of four men accused of killing <a href="31/index.html">Daniel Pearl</a>, a South Asia correspondent for the Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>CPJ defines journalists as <span>people who cover news or comment on public affairs in print, in photographs, on radio, on television, or online</span>. Writers, editors, publishers, producers, technicians, photographers, camera operators, and directors of news organizations are all included.</p>

        <p class="update">Methodology and sources</p>
        <p>This is my first news application developed after completing the <a href="https://first-news-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#">First News App</a> tutorial. I wrote a web scraper to collect data from the <a href="#">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> website to obtain biographical descriptions of each journalist's death. Using the GeoPy package, I converted locations to geographical coordinates &mdash; after cleaning and analyzing the data in pandas.</p>
        <p>My analysis can be found in <a href="https://github.com/aadittambe/south-asia-journalists/blob/master/analysis/scraper.ipynb">this</a> jupyter notebook.</p>

He suffered injuries to the head and abdomen, according to a report on the Free Press Kashmir news website. Two police officers, who had been assigned to protect him after an attack in 2000, were also fired at, the reports said. All three were rushed to the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital where they died, according to news reports. The Rising Kashmir office is located in Srinagar city’s Press Colony, a high-security zone that houses other media organizations, according to a report in The Telegraph newspaper. On June 15, police released images of three suspects on a motorcycle captured on closed-circuit TV, according to a report on the NDTV 24X7 news channel. SP Pani, the inspector general of the Jammu and Kashmir state police, told CPJ that Zubair Qadri, a fourth suspect, had been arrested on June 15 and a pistol was recovered from the scene of the crime. Footage showed him stealing a pistol from one of the slain security officers, according to a report on The Wire news website. When asked if any organization had claimed responsibility, Pani said that the killing was being treated as a &#34;terrorism-related&#34; crime and did not elaborate. When asked about the number of gunmen who killed Bukhari, Pani said this was &#34;a matter of investigation.” Amarjit Singh Dulat, a former director of Research and Analysis Wing, India’s external intelligence agency, claimed that Bukhari had approached Mehbooba Mufti, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, for “increased security” a few days before his death, according to news reports. Naeem Akhtar, a minister in the Jammu and Kashmir state government, did not take calls from CPJ seeking comment. Pani denied knowledge of the statement made by Dulat.",
