        <p>This is my first news applications developed after completing the <a href="https://first-news-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#">First News App</a> tutorial. I wrote a web scraper to collect data from the <a href="#">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> website to obtain biographical descriptions of each journalist's death. Using the GeoPy package, I converted locations to geographical coordinates &mdash; after cleaning and analyzing the data in pandas.</p>

He was 42.Violence broke out between rival factions of the ruling Awami League, namely supporters of Halimul Haque Miru, mayor of Shahjadpur, and his opponents from another faction of the party, according to news reports. Witnesses said that Miru opened fire in the confrontation, despite police instructions not to do so, according to media reports. A bullet entered Shimul’s skull after piercing one of his eyes, according to news reports. Shimul was first treated at a local clinic, but succumbed to his injuries on the way to a hospital in the capital Dhaka the following day.Police arrested Miru on February 5 on suspicion of being responsible for Shimul’s death. Miru admitted to firing his gun, but claimed he fired a shot in the air in response to shots fired by his rivals. Police said only Miru’s gun was fired, according to the Bangladeshi news website bdnews24.com.A court on February 6 ordered Miru jailed in connection with Shimul’s death, and said it would decide on the question of bail later. Police sought to hold Miru for at least seven days for questioning, according to news reports.According to media reports, Shimul’s maternal grandmother, Rokeya Begum, died of a stroke when she heard of his death. The journalist left behind a wife and two young children. His colleagues remembered Shimul as “honest journalist.” ",

Sahu was on a motorcycle toward the front of the group when the clash, in which two police officers were also killed, took place, according to the Indian Express.Chhattisgarh is one of four Indian states that have been the scene of a Maoist insurgency in the past few decades.According to the police, the media team were caught in the crossfire when Maoists attacked the police. Accounts differed as to whether the attack was related to the upcoming election or a dispute over road construction.Dheeraj Kumar, who was part of the Doordarshan news crew, told The Hindustan Times that the group was ambushed as it headed toward Nilwaya, about 5km (3 miles) from a paramilitary camp in Sameli, a village in the Dantewada district. &#34;I saw my colleague fall in front of me,&#34; Kumar said. &#34;We were planning to cover a newly-built polling station in Nilwaya where people haven’t voted since 1998.&#34;Special director general of police D.M. Awasthi told the media the attack was related to road construction. “Naxals warned about causing harm if the road construction work continued,” he said. Sahu and his team arrived to cover the road construction ahead of the polls when the attack took place, according to Awasthi.The Communist Party of India (Maoist) released a statement taking responsibility for Sahu’s death, according to the Press Trust of India. “It is sad that camera person Achyutananda Sahu was killed in the attack. We had no intention to target media personnel,” Sainath, the secretary of the Dharba division of CPI (Maoist) said in the statement. He also advised journalists not to embed with police when in conflict zones.In response to the killing, Rajyavardhan Rathore, who heads the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that has responsibility for the station, tweeted, &#34;Stand in solidarity with family of the cameraman, we will take care of his family. We salute all those media persons who go for coverage in such dangerous situations, remember their bravery.&#34; According to NDTV, he ordered compensation of 15,00,000 Indian rupees (US$21,000) to be paid to the journalist’s family.

News reports said activists of the Shahbagh movement also blamed members of the Islami Chhatra Shibir for the blogger’s death. The student wing has been involved in sporadic street attacks since the protests began, according to reports.Members of the Jamaat-e-Islami party denied the accusations, reports said.News reports also cited Haider’s relatives and friends as saying the blogger was killed for the posts he wrote urging that the alleged war criminals be brought to justice. News reports citing another Bangladeshi blogger, Shakil Ahmed, said that a pro-Jamaat website had named Haider as a target the week before his death.News accounts reported that Haider also used his Facebook page to publicize the protests and encourage demonstrators to attend them. The day before his death, the blogger had participated in the protests, reports said. On February 11, 2013, a blog, called Sonarbangla, which is run by members of the Jamaat-e-Islami party and its student wing, published a story calling Haider one of the main organizers of the protests, news reports said.Police arrested five individuals who confessed to the murder and said they had received an order from an Islami Chhatra Shibir leader to kill Haider, and that it was their religious obligation to do so, reports said. Police told the media that the plot to kill the blogger had been formed several months prior in connection with Haider’s Facebook posts that criticized Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist groups.On December 31, 2015, a Dhaka court convicted and sentenced two students to death for Haider’s murder, including Rezwanul Azad Rana, a fugitive who was charged in absentia and who was described by police as the mastermind, according to news reports. Six others were convicted in the attack, according to The Associated Press. The court sentenced Jashim Uddin Rahmani, the leader of banned Islamist group Ansarullah Bangla Team, to five years in jail for “abetting murder” by inciting students to kill secular bloggers; one student was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder; and four others were jailed for three years on lesser charges, according to news reports. A lawyer for the defendants said they would appeal, reports said.CPJ research showed an escalation in attacks against online journalists in Bangladesh since the beginning of 2013. In early April, authorities arrested four journalists, one of whom had been stabbed a few months prior.Haider’s funeral procession was attended by tens of thousands. He is survived by his wife. ",

Rilwan was last seen on August 7, 2014, according to news reports and CPJ reporting, and had been considered missing for five years. Rilwan was forced into a car outside of his home at knifepoint in the early hours of August 8, 2014, according to the same reports. Al Suuod said he was then taken to a boat out at sea, where he was killed, according to Al-Jazeera. Al Suood said that Rilwan had been killed for his writing about alleged Al-Qaeda links in the Maldives and his advocacy for freedom of expression, according to news reports.The commission identified several individuals suspected of involvement in Rilwan’s abduction and killing, and subsequent government interference in the case, according to a report by Rilwan’s employer, which has since changed its name to The Maldives Independent. The commission asked the prosecutor general’s office to appeal the 2018 acquittals of two suspects charged over Rilwan’s abduction, given the new evidence, according to the Independent.Al Suood also recommended obstruction of justice charges be filed against former Vice President Ahmed Adeeb for allegedly intervening to release two suspects allegedly involved in Rilwan’s disappearance, and also said the commission found evidence that former President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom tried to “divert the focus of the police investigation,” but added that there was not enough evidence to recommend charges, the Independent reported.Yameen’s lawyer dismissed allegations of undue interference, and Adeeb has previously denied any involvement in Rilwan’s case, according to Al-Jazeera.The prosecutor general’s office in the Maldives did not immediately respond to CPJ’s request for comment via messaging app.  ",

He had also written numerous books, one on evolution. Das, who worked for a bank as his day job, had mainly written on science. He had also been critical of religious fundamentalism and previous attacks on secular thinkers in his writing, CNN reported.According to news reports which cited Imran Sarker, head of an organization of secular bloggers, Das was also an activist during the 2013 Shahbag movement, which called for the death penalty for leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami party who were on trial for war crimes.The day before he was killed, Das wrote a post on Facebook in which he criticized police for their handling of the investigation into the murders of Bangladeshi bloggers Roy and Washiqur Rahman Babu, according to The Associated Press.Das’s murder came just weeks after the attack on Babu, who was hacked to death in the street on March 30, 2015. In February 2015, Roy and his wife, Rafida Ahmed Bonna, were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting Dhaka, according to news reports. Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was killed and his wife was critically injured.In early May 2015, an Al-Qaeda branch claimed responsibility for the attack on Roy and his wife as well as for the 2013 murder of blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider in a video posted online, according to reports. The video also urged followers to carry out other such attacks against “blasphemers.”Debasish Debu, a friend of Das, told journalists that the blogger had received threats for his writing and that the frequency of threats increased after the attack on Roy.Police said they were investigating the murder, but no immediate arrests were made, news reports said. On May 13, 2015, The New York Times reported that Islamist extremists claimed responsibility for Das’s murder. ",

Roy and Bonna were taken to a local hospital, where Roy was pronounced dead, according to news reports. Bonna was critically wounded.Roy, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was visiting Bangladesh to attend the book fair, news accounts said. The blogger had covered secular issues including science, homosexuality, atheism, and free expression on his blog, Mukto-Mona (Free Mind), and had published several books on those issues, news reports said. Roy, a Hindu, was critical of religious fundamentalism in his writings on Bangladesh, a predominantly Muslim country.The blogger had reported receiving death threats from Islamists to his friends and family and to the U.K.-based human rights organization the International Humanist and Ethical Union, the organization said. The blogger’s father told journalists that Roy had received threatening messages over email and on social media from individuals who were unhappy with his writing, news reports said.Police said they suspected Islamist radicals were involved in the murder, according to news reports. In 2013, Islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy, according to news reports.The killing attracted international attention. Agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation arrived about a week after Roy’s murder to assist local police in the investigation, according to news reports. On March 2, 2015 Bangladeshi authorities arrested Shafiur Rahman Farabi, a 29-year-old student and a Muslim blogger who had often preached radicalism, according to news reports.On February 16, 2021, a Bangladesh court sentenced five people to death for their involvement in Roy’s killing, and another to life in prison, according to news reports.The court sentenced Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque, Akram Hossain, Abu Siddique Sohel, Mozammel Hossain, and Arafat Rahman to death by hanging, and Shafiur Rahman Farabi to life imprisonment, according to those reports. The six defendants were all members of the banned militant outfit Ansar al-Islam, and killed Roy for being a “secular writer,” according to those reports.Haque and Akram are in hiding and were sentenced in absentia, while the others were in custody, according to the BBC, which stated that lawyers for the defendants planned to appeal the verdict.

At least 50 people were injured during the demonstration, including nine who were shot, according to that report. CPJ could not determine who fired the shots that killed Muzakkir.On February 23, Muzakkir’s father, Nurul Huda Master, filed a police murder case over the journalist’s killing, according to news reports, which said that the case did not name any assailants, and that police had opened an investigation.CPJ emailed the Bangladeshi police for comment but did not receive any response.Barta Bazar did not immediately reply to CPJ’s request for comment via messaging app. CPJ was unable to find contact information for Bangladesh Samachar.

Police said the reporter was found injured in a forest about 175 miles from Pathalgada, in Jharkhand.  He succumbed to his injuries the next day, according to NDTV. Jharkhand police identified four people–Maoist area commander Prasant, Pintu Singh, Jamuna Prasad, and Musafir Rana–as suspects who abducted and killed the journalist. Police arrested Prasant, Prasad, and Rana, but Singh remained free as of December 2018. The First Information Report filed by the police–which has been reviewed by CPJ–names all four suspects. Local reporters told CPJ that Maoists run a criminal network in the area, and that Singh is part of this network.According to a report in Dainik Bhaskar, police claim that Singh targeted Tiwari for alleging financial irregularities in Singh’s role as a private contractor for a government-funded program to support rural employment. On April 2, 2018, Tiwari published a story about Singh’s alleged corruption; and also posted about it on his Facebook page. Chatra police superintendent Akhilesh B. Variar told Dainik Bhaskar that Singh plotted against Tiwari because of the financial loss he incurred from Tiwari’s reporting. Tiwari’s editor, Amit Kumar Agrawal, told CPJ that the slain reporter had filed a complaint on April 6, 2018, with the police about a possible threat to his life. A copy of the complaint is available on Tiwari’s Facebook page. Agrawal also told NDTV that police did not act on the complaint. As of late 2018, police had not filed a charge sheet in the case. When reached by phone by CPJ for comment on the case, Variar asked to be contacted by email. As of late 2018, Variar had not responded to questions via email. ",

                    "desc": "U.S. government officials confirmed on February 21, 2002, that Pearl, kidnapped South Asia correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, had been killed by his captors. The exact date of his murder was uncertain, but authorities announced his death after receiving a graphic, three-and-a-half minute digital videotape containing scenes in which one of the killers slits Pearl’s throat, and then someone holds his severed head. The faces of the assailants are not visible on the video. This, and other details below, are documented in an extensive report on Pearl’s murder, entitled The Truth Left Behind: Inside the Kidnapping and Murder of Daniel Pearl, published in 2011 by The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and The Center for Public Integrity. Pearl, 38, went missing on January 23, 2002, in the port city of Karachi, Pakistan, and was last seen on his way to an interview at the Village Restaurant, downtown near the Metropole Hotel. According to The Wall Street Journal, Pearl had been reporting on Richard Reid, a suspected terrorist who allegedly tried to blow up an airplane during a transatlantic flight with a bomb in his shoe. Four days after his disappearance, a group calling itself &#34;The National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty&#34; sent an e-mail to several U.S.- and Pakistan-based news organizations claiming responsibility for kidnapping Pearl and accusing him of being an American spy. The e-mail also contained four photographs of the journalist, including one in which he is held at gunpoint and another in which he is holding a copy of the January 24 issue of Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper. The e-mail contained a series of demands, including the repatriation of Pakistani detainees held by the U.S. Army in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The sender or senders, who used a Hotmail e-mail account under the name &#34;Kidnapperguy,&#34; said Pearl was &#34;at present being kept in very inhuman circumstances quite similar infact [sic] to the way that Pakistanis and nationals of other sovereign countries are being kept in Cuba by the American Army.&#34; Another e-mail was sent on January 30, also including photographs of Pearl held captive. This e-mail accused him of being an agent of Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, and said he would be killed within 24 hours unless the group’s demands were met. After scrutinizing the videotape that officials received weeks later, authorities believe that Pearl may have been murdered before the second e-mail was sent. During that footage, Pearl is forced to identify himself as Jewish and to deliver scripted lines reiterating some of the demands made in the e-mails, according to an FBI analysis of the tape that was provided to the Journal. On February 12, 2002, before Pearl’s murder was discovered, Pakistani police announced the arrest of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, whom they identified as the prime suspect behind the journalist’s kidnapping. On March 14, a U.S. grand jury indicted Saeed, charging him with hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking resulting in Pearl’s murder. U.S. prosecutors also unsealed a secret indictment filed against Saeed in November 2001 accusing him of participating in the 1994 kidnapping of U.S. tourist Bela Nuss in India. Pakistan refused to extradite Saeed, possibly to avoid damaging disclosures of links between the country’s intelligence agencies and militant Islamist groups that the United States wants to see eliminated. In April, Saeed and three accomplices–Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem, and Shaikh Adil–were charged with Pearl’s kidnapping and murder before Pakistan’s special anti-terrorism court. The trial, initially convened at Karachi’s Central Jail and later moved to a heavily guarded prison in Hyderabad due to security concerns, was closed to journalists and the public. In mid-May, as the trial was under way, police found a dismembered body believed to be Pearl’s buried in the outskirts of Karachi on property owned by the Al-Rashid Trust, an Islamic charity that the United States has accused of funneling money to al-Qaeda. Police were reportedly led to the shallow grave by Fazal Karim, a member of the banned militant Sunni Muslim group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. At year’s end, Karim had not been charged, and though it has been widely reported that he was detained, authorities have never officially acknowledged his arrest. On July 15, 2002, the anti-terrorism court announced that Saeed and his accomplices were guilty of Pearl’s kidnapping and murder. Saeed, who was accused of masterminding the crime, was sentenced to death by hanging; Saqib, Naseem, and Adil each received 25-year prison sentences. They appealed the ruling. Shortly after the ruling, U.S. officials announced DNA test results confirming that the body found in May was indeed Pearl’s.In mid-August, 2002, The Associated Press (AP) published a detailed account of Pearl’s kidnapping, citing two investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity. The officials said that, according to Karim (who had led police to the journalist’s body in May) and two others held in unofficial custody, Pearl was shot and wounded on the sixth day of his capture when he tried to escape and was murdered on the ninth day. The AP identified the two other detainees as Zubair Chishti and Naeem Bukhari, who is also known as Attaur Rehman and is a leader of the sectarian group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. The men also said that three Arabs, possibly from Yemen, were brought to the hideout on the ninth day, and that they were involved in filming and carrying out the execution. Karim later identified one of the Yemenis among those arrested in a September 11, 2002, raid in Karachi, during which U.S. and Pakistani authorities detained several suspected al-Qaeda members, including Ramzi Binalshibh, allegedly a senior al-Qaeda leader who has claimed a central role in coordinating the September 11 attacks.In 2007, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, suspected of masterminding the 9/11 attacks in the U.S., was reported to have confessed to a U.S. military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to personally having slit Pearl’s throat, according to news reports. A trial date for Mohammed’s role in the 9/11 attack has been set for January 11, 2021, although it’s not certain if the trial will proceed, according to news reports. A former U.S. intelligence officer, Robert Baer, told the United Press International (UPI) news agency in 2002 that he had given Pearl information about Mohammed, and that he believes it was the journalist’s investigations of Mohammed that may have cost him his life. Baer, who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 20 years in Asia and the Middle East and wrote the book See No Evil, which criticizes the CIA, told UPI, &#34;I have heard from [intelligence] people who follow this closely that it was people close to Mohammed that killed him, if it wasn’t Mohammed himself.&#34; UPI quoted a Wall Street Journal spokesperson as saying that, &#34;Everything we know from before and after Danny’s murder indicates his reporting effort focused on [alleged shoe bomber] Richard Reid.&#34;On April 2, 2020, the Sindh High Court overturned the murder convictions of the four men accused in Pearl’s killing, according to news reports. The decision found Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had previously been sentenced to death, guilty only of kidnapping Pearl and reduced his sentence to seven years, which he has already served. The Pearl family and the Sindh provincial government appealed, and the four men remained imprisoned as of October 2020, awaiting further action by the Supreme Court, according to news reports. ",

Local sources told CPJ that Thapa’s killing was connected to his work as a journalist.After the slaying, local rebel commanders told Thapa’s family that they intended to kill 10 other journalists in neighboring districts, according to local news reports.Members of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) abducted Thapa on June 26, and a rebel commander said on August 16 that they had executed him on August 11, according to local news reports.Maoist rebels posted leaflets in Thapa’s hometown in Dailekh on August 17 “charging” him with 10 counts of crimes against what the rebels refer to as their “people’s regime.” Among other accusations, the rebels accused Thapa of spying for state security forces while using his profession as a cover.Thapa belonged to the Federation of Nepalese Journalists (FNJ) and was an adviser to the local branch of Human Rights and Peace Society, a Nepalese human rights group. A delegation from FNJ met with Maoists in Dailekh to make appeals on Thapa’s behalf before the rebels said they killed him.Journalists took to the streets of the capital, Kathmandu, on August 18 to protest Thapa’s killing, according to local news reports. Local journalists said that his killing and the subsequent death threats were intended to silence the press in the Maoist-controlled midwestern districts of Nepal.In a rare response to journalists’ outrage, Maoist spokesman Krishna Bahadur Mahara wrote a letter to FNJ in September in which he called the murder a breach of policy, promised to investigate the killing and to respect press freedom, and stated that the party had conducted “self-criticism” on the matter.In January 2013, police arrested five suspects in connection with the killing. In December 2014, a local court convicted them all and sentenced them to two years in prison for the abduction and murder, Agence France-Presse reported. Rights activists and the family slammed the sentence as too lenient; four other former Maoists accused in the murder case were on the run, the report said.On December 15, 2020, police arrested Hari Lal Pun, a Maoist, according to the local press freedom organization Freedom Forum. Pun had previously been arrested and convicted for his involvement in the killing, but he had fled before completing the last four months of his term, according to that report.In March 2020, police arrested Bam Bahadur Khadka, one of the four who was on the run at the time of the 2013 sentencing, according to the Freedom Forum.

The TamilNet news Web site reported that his body was found in a high-security area behind a parliament building.  A founding member and contributor to TamilNet and a military and political columnist for the English language Daily Mirror, Sivaram wrote sympathetically about the rebel group the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Police searched his house twice last year looking for weapons but did not find anything.  The LTTE split into two warring factions in 2004 after a rebel leader known as Colonel Karuna broke away to form his own rival army in eastern Sri Lanka. A cycle of violence has escalated from the east throughout the country, with the warring Tamil factions going on killing sprees that target each other’s alleged supporters, including journalists.  A pro-LTTE Tamil lawmaker, Amirthanathan Adaikkalanathan, told The Associated Press that Sivaram’s last article for the Tamil-language daily Virekasari criticized the rebel leader Karuna.

The cameraman, 36, worked for the news division of the satellite-distributed Prime News channel that covers northeast India. News reports initially identified Singh using different spellings of his name.Prime News reported that Singh was shot in the chest and died at a local hospital. Police said the journalist was shot by accident while they were trying to disperse protesters with live ammunition, according to news reports. Five police officers were suspended, the reports said.Protesters gathered in Imphal to demonstrate against the reported December 18 public sexual assault of Momoko, a local actress, by members of a separatist group, according to news reports. The protest was also part of mass demonstrations against the sexual assault of women after the December 16 gang rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi.In December 2012, the All Manipur Working Journalists’ Union and the state government signed a memorandum of understanding in connection with the death of Singh, according to news accounts. The memorandum called for the immediate suspension of the police officers allegedly involved in the shooting, pending investigation; for financial assistance to be provided to the cameraman’s family; and for the creation of media policies to address the welfare of journalists, including those reporting in conflict situations.That same week, the state government suspended officers ASI K Romendro Singh and Kh Naba-kumar Singh, pending a departmental investigation, reports said.The state government announced Rs. 500,000 (US $7,400) compensation to the family, according to reports.According to the journalist union, there were no further proceedings in the case against the police officers. CPJ called the union on several occasions in spring 2016 to seek comment but the calls were not answered. L.M.Khoute, the ADGP, Law and Order did not respond to CPJ’s request for comment in spring 2016.Local journalists told Al-Jazeera that Singh was survived by two children. ",

An autopsy report showed the publisher’s body had multiple stab wounds, according to reports.The publishing house, in the Shahbagh area of the capital, released short stories, poetry, novels, and essays on progressive topics. Dipan’s company had published Biswasher Virus (The Virus of Faith), in 2014 by Avijit Roy, a blogger who received death threats after the book was published, according to reports. Roy was hacked to death in Dhaka in February 2015, CPJ research shows.Dipan’s father, Abul Kashem Fazlul Haq, told journalists he suspected his son was targeted because he published Roy’s books, news reports said. Friends of the publisher said Dipan had filed a police complaint after death threats appeared on Facebook, The Associated Press reported. CPJ was unable to determine when the threats were made and whether they were posted to his personal or professional Facebook page.Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent claimed responsibility on social media for the attack on Dipan and a separate attack the same day in which a publisher in Dhaka was severely injured, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorist activity worldwide. One of the statements, which has been viewed by CPJ and which was posted on October 31, 2015, alongside a tweet by someone claiming to be part of Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, said Dipan and the other publisher who was attacked were “worse than the writers of such books, as they helped propagate these books and paid the blasphemers handsome amounts of money for writing them. These secular and atheist publishers waged war against the religion of Islam in every possible ways. One of them also published books in support of homosexuality.”Bangladeshi police said they were investigating the credibility of claims that Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent is responsible for the killing.On February 10, 2021, a Bangladesh Court sentenced eight people to death for their involvement in Dipan’s killing, according to news reports.The court sentenced Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque, Akram Hossain, Abu Siddique Sohel, Mozammel Hossain, Moinul Hasan Shamim, Md Abdus Sabur, Khairul Islam, and Md Sheikh Abdullah to death, and ruled that they had killed Dipan for publishing Roy’s book, those reports said.Four of the convicted, Haque, Akram Hossain, Mozammel Hossain, and Sohel were also separately convicted and sentenced to death for their role in Roy’s killing, according to news reports. Haque and Akram are in hiding and were sentenced in absentia, while the others are in custody, according to the reports.The defendants were all members of the banned militant outfit Ansar al-Islam, which is affiliated with Al-Qaeda, according to Al-Jazeera.

She was shot in the head and chest and died immediately, according to a report in the Hindustan Times.Lankesh published and edited Gauri Lankesh Patrike, a Kannada-language weekly tabloid known for its criticism of right-wing extremism and the establishment, according to media reports. The newspaper covered issues including communal violence and the caste system.Lankesh was part of a government panel involved in shaping a Maoist surrender to state police, according to reports. According to the BBC, the journalist was sympathetic to the Maoist rebels and was involved in the reintegration of former rebels.K. Siddaramiah, the chief minister of Karnataka state, ordered a 21-member special investigation team from the police to investigate Lankesh’s killing, according to the Indian Express. Inderjit Lankesh, the journalist’s brother, said in an interview with NDTV that India’s national agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation, should examine her case. He said that Gauri Lankesh received a lot of hate mail from those who sympathized with the Maoist rebels and said that the investigation should investigate whether Hindu extremists or Maoist rebels are behind the killing, according to India Today. B.T. Venkatesh, a lawyer who represented Gauri Lankesh, alleged in an interview with the media watchdog The Hoot that her murder “was a pre-planned and sinister attack by Hindu terror units.”The special investigation team filed its initial charge sheet in May 2018, and filed an additional 9,325-page sheet in November 2018, accusing 18 people in connection with the killing, according to a report by NDTV. On January 10, 2020, police made their seventeenth arrest, according to news reports. One suspect remained in hiding as of January 11, according to NDTV.  Police allege that the killers were members of a criminal syndicate with links to the right-wing Hindu organization Sanatan Sanstha and its offshoot Hindu Janjagruti Samiti, that the suspects were also behind the killings of scholars Narendra Dabholkar and M. M. Kalburgi, and that the syndicate targeted people because of their ideology, according to news reports,A Sanatan Sanstha representative condemned Lankesh’s killing, according to reports. The group said that the journalist was a Maoist sympathizer who it had nothing to do with, according to reports. Lankesh started her career in the 1980s, working as a reporter for English-language dailies including Mid-Day and The Times of India, and the weekly magazine, Sunday. In 2000, after the death of their father, P. Lankesh, Gauri and Indrajit ran Lankesh Patrike, the Kannada-language tabloid their father founded in 1980, according to a profile in Mint. In 2004, she started Gauri Lankesh Patrike.Lankesh said in an interview with the website NewsLaundry in November 2016, that she had been criticized for her reporting and work. Lankesh said, “Unfortunately, today anybody talking in support of human rights and against fake encounters is branded a Maoist supporter … Along with that, my criticism of Hindutva politics and the caste system, which is part and parcel of what is considered ‘Hindu dharma’ [Hindu duty] makes my critics brand me as a ‘Hindu hater.’”Lankesh had previously faced legal action over her critical reporting. At the time of her death, she was appealing a six-month prison sentence and fine of 10,000 Indian rupee (US$155) for criminal defamation. The November 2016 conviction was over a 2008 article, according to a report on The Wire. A magistrate granted Lankesh bail and allowed her to appeal the sentence in a higher court, according to a report in The Indian Express. Her lawyer said he didn’t think the killing was related to a defamation case, according to reports.

At 2 p.m., police broke down the door of the office to find Das’ body inside, with fractures to the legs and hand and nylon rope around his neck, according to a statement by the group.  Although colleagues were not aware of any specific threat against the reporter, they said that Das had written about sensitive topics such as the activities of Islamist militant groups, according to Media Watch. Sumi Khan, a reporter for Samakal, said that Das was known for his reporting on crime and corruption, including coverage of illegal activities by members of the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The Associated Press reported that Das had recently written about local government officials accused of taking bribes in exchange for construction contract awards.  Two days later, journalist groups around the country protested the killing and criticized the government for not doing more to protect the press.  On November 19, police arrested Tamjid Hossain Babu, the son of a local MP, in connection with Das’ murder, according to The Daily Star. Local journalists said police arrested three other suspects.In 2006, Das’ murder case was transferred from the local district court to the Dhaka Speedy Tribunal Court 1 for expedited judgment after pressure from local journalists. One defendant challenged the legality of this transfer, which resulted in further delays, according to reports.On June 27, 2013, a court sentenced nine individuals to life in prison in connection with Das’ murder. Eight of the nine convicted were junior politicians belonging to the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, including Babu, according to news reports.At the time, many local journalists hailed the verdict as a landmark, the first time a Bangladeshi court has successfully prosecuted a murder of a journalist.On January 30, 2019, the High Court upheld the sentences of five of those who were convicted and acquitted four others, according to news reports.

Local governmentofficials and family members said Khan, 32, had been found handcuffed and shotseveral times.

International news mediaidentified the fragments in the photographs as part of a Hellfire missile,possibly fired from a U.S. drone.Khan, who was also a reporter for the Urdu-language dailyAusaf, had received numerous threats from Pakistani security forces, Talibanmembers, and local tribesmen because of his reporting.During Khan’s six-month disappearance, government officialsprovided his family with numerous and often contradictory accounts of hiswhereabouts: Khan was in government custody, soon to be released; Khan had beenabducted by  “miscreants”;  he had been taken by Waziristan mujahideen;he had been flown to the military base at Rawalpindi and was then detained inKohat air base.Khan’s relatives were told by hospital workers that he hadfive or six bullet wounds and that one hand had been manacled in handcuffstypically used by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate.

Kabir was taken to Khulna Medical College Hospital and died soon thereafter. Kabir’s son Asif also suffered minor injuries on his legs and was treated at a local clinic.An underground leftist group known as Janajuddha (People’s War), a faction of the Purbo Banglar Communist Party, claimed responsibility for the killing in phone calls to several local newspapers and journalists the day of the murder, according to local journalists.Kabir, 58, was a veteran journalist and the president of the Khulna Press Club. He published bold articles criticizing organized crime groups in Bangladesh’s southwestern region. After his friend and fellow journalist Manik Saha was killed in a similar attack earlier in 2004, Kabir criticized the criminal groups implicated in Saha’s killing. Janajuddha also claimed responsibility for killing Saha.Kabir had recently received death threats, according to local news reports.Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and other high-ranking government officials condemned Kabir’s murder and pledged to find and punish those responsible. Local journalist groups spoke out against the killing and called for a week of mourning.Shortly after the attack, local police said they detained nine suspects, the BBC reported.Two other suspects in the case, leaders of the Janajuddha faction, died in separate shootouts with police in late August 2004. Authorities accuse the deceased suspects–Altaf Hossain and Imam Sarder–of involvement in Kabir’s killing and say they were also responsible for killing Saha, according to local news reports.In 2008, seven of the accused were acquitted, according to the Daily Star. On January 18, 2021, a court in Khulna sentenced five people to life in prison and fined them 10,000 Takas (US $118) for their involvement in the killing, according to that report, which identified the five as Syed Iqbal Hossain, Zahid Hossain, Nazul, Masum, and Rimon, and noted that Masum had absconded at the time of the sentencing.

Its residents face criminal activity, daily disappearances, and targeted killings, and international journalists are routinely denied access to the province, according to CPJ research. Local journalists in Baluchistan face pressure from a number of sources: pro-Taliban groups and Pakistani security forces and intelligence agencies, as well as separatists and state-sponsored anti-separatist militant groups, CPJ research shows.

In the statement, news reports cite the journalist as saying, “Prakash Rai was there and along with him were present four, five police personnel. The police team, led by Prakash Rai, barged into the house and started assaulting me. They could have as well arrested me.”The journalist also accused Ram Murti Singh Verma, a member of the ruling Samajwadi Party in India’s most populous state, of “unleashing a reign of terror” on him and his family in reprisal for his investigative reports and critical comments against the minister, Times News Network reported. “Why did they have to burn me?” he reportedly says in the video. “If the minister and his people had something against me, they could have hit me and beaten me instead of pouring kerosene over me and burning me.”Singh also told Thakur that his foot was broken during an earlier attack on April 28 near his house, by people he alleged were “the minister’s henchmen.”Singh’s son, Raghvendra, filed a police complaint that named Verma and Rai, according to the Press Trust of India. Raghvendra Singh told The Associated Press that police “barged into our house and questioned my father about the posts. … They started beating him up. … They poured petrol over him and set him on fire.”Police Superintendent Babloo Kumar told CPJ in 2015 that Singh killed himself when police attempted to arrest him. He said Singh was “wanted in a crime” and denied that he was a journalist, saying “he only wrote on social media.” When asked for further details, Kumar told CPJ Singh was wanted for murder. He said “I don’t remember” when CPJ asked for details of the murder in which the journalist was accused of being involved.In September 2016, The Times of India reported that Uttar Pradesh state police had dropped the charges against Singh that they had said were the reason for his arrest. According to the report, police in May 2015 registered a case of attempted murder and kidnapping against Singh after a complaint by Amit Bhadauria, also a journalist.Singh wrote on local politics and current affairs in Hindi-language newspapers and on his two Facebook pages, which have more than 4,000 followers combined. English- and Hindi-language news reports did not specify what newspapers he had written for. His son said Singh posted news stories on Facebook based on information he obtained through India’s Right to Information law and other sources, according to The Indian Express.Singh often wrote critically about Verma, alleging that he was involved in illegal mining and land grabs, the reports said. In a May 31 Hindi-language Facebook post with an accompanying photo of Verma, the journalist alleged that the minister was involved in the gang rape of a local woman, claims that were also reported in Hindi-language media. In another post a day earlier, Singh questioned the land holdings amassed by the minister.In a Facebook post on May 22, Singh wrote: “Ram Murti Singh Verma can have me killed. At this time, politician, thugs, and police, all are after me. Writing the truth is bearing heavily on my life. After exposing some of Ram Murti Verma’s acts, he had me attacked…”CPJ was not able to reach Verma for response to the allegations against him.No arrests were made immediately after Singh’s death. In the days following Singh’s death, local journalists and members of other political parties called on the chief minister of the state, Akhilesh Yadav, to remove Verma from his cabinet, according to news reports. A public interest litigation filed at the Allahabad High Court demanded a probe by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, news reports said. ",

A transfer of land to a Hindu shrine in June fueled protests in the unstable Muslim majority state, where separatist groups lead an often violent movement for independence for Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan.By spring 2016, no investigation had been conducted into the shooting. According to an independent investigation by the human rights group, the People’s Union for Democratic Rights, when Mir’s family tried to file a First Information Report, police said four witnesses would be needed to corroborate their account that security forces had opened fire on the journalist.

The motive for the killing was not immediately clear, police said, although colleagues told reporters they believed Dey had been targeted for his reporting.Dey had covered crime in Mumbai for 22 years and had written two books, Zero Dial: The Dangerous World of Informers and Khallas.In November 2011, a journalist named Jigna Vora was arrested in connection with the murder for allegedly playing a part in the conspiracy to kill Dey, according to reports. In June 2015, a special court of the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act charged 10 suspects, including Vora and an alleged crime boss Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje, also known as Chhota Rajan, according to reports. Nikalje was deported from Bali to India in November 2015, reports said. In January 2016, officers from the Central Bureau of Investigation questioned Nikalje about the killing of Dey. Vora denied the allegation, according to reports. A 2016 supplementary charge sheet prepared by the CBI alleged that Nikalje confessed to the murder to a journalist, The Hindu reported. It quoted Nikalje as saying: “J. Dey was writing many articles against me in newspapers. Hence I contacted him and enquired politely whether he has any personal enmity with me. He declined but continued writing against me.. like my gang has become weak and that I am sick, my loyal people have left me etc. All such write-ups of J Dey angered me. Hence I developed an impression that he had started working for the Dawood gang. I tried to convince him before killing him. But he did not listen. I am not sure whether he was really close to Dawood gang.. but his writings made me feel like that.”On May 2, 2018, a Mumbai court found Nikhalje guilty of ordering Dey’s murder because of articles and books that Dey wrote, according to news reports. The court convicted and sentenced Nikhalje and eight others to life in prison for murder and criminal conspiracy, according to reports.The court acquitted Vora, a former deputy bureau chief of Asian Age, of conspiring to murder Dey, according to reports.

Misra, who was the Ambedkar Nagar bureau chief of the Hindi daily Jansandesh Times, died from his injuries on the way to the hospital, according to The Hindu.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav expressed his “deep concern” about the journalist’s death, and ordered Director-General of Police Javeed Ahmed to form special teams to investigate the case, according to press reports.On February 18, 2016 police arrested five people in connection with Misra’s murder, according to news reports. Inspector General A. Satish Ganesh, of the Lucknow-zone, issued a statement saying that two mining contractors in the area were allegedly upset with Misra’s coverage of illegal mining for his paper. Ganesh named two local mining contractors–Rahul Singh and Pawan Singh–as the suspected masterminds behind Misra’s murder. The pair allegedly paid five locals 100,000 Indian rupees (approximately US$1,500) to kill Misra, according to the police statement. CPJ was unable to determine if they have denied the accusations. Both contractors and three of the five men they allegedly hired, identified as Ajay Singh, Sandeep Singh, and Haider Abbas, were arrested following a joint operation by Sultanpur police and the state’s Special Task Force, an investigative body set up to investigate criminal matters including mafia activities in the state. During questioning, the three men allegedly hired by the contractors confessed to murdering Misra, reports said. Police were still searching for two other suspects, identified as Aman Singh and Mama, who was identified by only one name. CPJ is unable to determine if the suspects have been officially charged or if they are being held in custody.An officer at the Kudwar police station was suspended for not taking adequate measures to address illegal mining in the area, reports said.

Animam was injured in the attack.Taliban spokesmen spoke to several news outlets, takingresponsibility for the killing. Ihsanullah Ihsan told The Associated Press thatAatif had been warned “a number of times to stop anti-Taliban reporting, but hedidn’t do so. He finally met his fate.”Several CPJ sources said they were skeptical Aatif had beenkilled on the orders of the Taliban or for the publicly stated reasons. Aatiftold friends and relatives that he started receiving threats from military andintelligence officials immediately after covering a November 2011 attack byU.S.-led NATO forces on Pakistani army check posts at Salala, near the borderwith Afghanistan. Twenty-four Pakistani soldiers died in the attack. Aatiffiled reports on the attack for Deewa Radio and took part in what are calledtwo-ways, which are live exchanges with the station’s studio journalists. Aatif had spoken to local residents who said a Talibanhideout was just two kilometers from the army check posts, a tribal areajournalist told CPJ. The Taliban’s proximity to the army posts was highlysensitive information because it could have provided justification for theAmerican attack. An official with the U.S. National Security Council told CPJthat a Special Forces team launched the attack after taking fire from the areaof the Pakistani check posts. Deewa Radio said Aatif’s reports explained the geography ofthe area but did not mention the Taliban. Deewa did not respond to CPJ’srepeated queries seeking information on what was said by the station’s studiojournalists during their live two-way exchanges with Aatif. Deewa said noarchive of Aatif’s reports was available. Multiple CPJ sources in Pakistan andthe United States said the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate was believedto be behind the murder.

Shankar had also written about corruption in the rice mill trade shortly before his death, according to The Hoot, a South Asian media watchdog group. The journalist, who was also honorary president of a Guntur press club had written a series of stories on allegations of corruption in the public distribution system, news reports said.A statement by the Indian Journalists Union said Shankar was killed for his coverage of a group that had engaged in the illegal sale on the black market of rationed essential items, including kerosene oil, for the poor, which was supplied through the country’s food security system known as the Public Distribution System, reports said. Thirty-eight percent of kerosene is smuggled or misused to adulterate diesel oil, according to news reports citing the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.In January 2013, an activist was murdered in the nearby Maharashtra state after he exposed the illegal sales of kerosene oil and ration cards. An official working as a district collector was burned alive in Maharashtra state in 2011, allegedly by members of the “oil mafia,” according to news accounts.The Minister for Agriculture, P. Pulla Rao, condemned the murder and ordered an investigation. A day later, Nimmakayala China Rajappa, the Andhra Pradesh home minister, directed police to form a special team to investigate the case and promised Shankar’s family that justice would be served, according to The Hoot.In April 2016, Narayan Naik, superintendent of police for Guntar, told CPJ a suspect had been charged in connection with the murder, but did not provide further details.Shankar is survived by his wife, according to news accounts.

The assailants shot the journalist through the window of his study, where he was working on an article, and threw a grenade into the home before fleeing the premises. The attack occurred during curfew hours in a high-security zone in central Jaffna town. Army officers were summoned to the house, and they took the journalist to Jaffna Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The journalist’s parents and his 11-year-old nephew were seriously injured in the attack. Local journalists suspect that Nimalarajan’s reporting on vote-rigging and intimidation in Jaffna during the recent parliamentary elections may have led to his murder. Sri Lankan president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga ordered defense authorities to launch an immediate inquiry into the assassination.

The gunmen fled the scene. Dabholkar died from injuries sustained to his neck and back, police said.Dabholkar was the editor of a weekly Marathi-language print magazine called Sadhana (Spiritual Devotion), which promotes scientific thought and covers topics including caste, politics, and religion. Over the years, Dabholkar had angered many Indians with his lectures and writings, which propagated rationalism and scientific thinking in a country where superstitious beliefs are still rampant, the reports said.Dabholkar, a prominent campaigner against religious superstition, had also spent several years writing in support of legislation to ban fraudulent and exploitative superstitious practices. A few days before his murder, the Maharashtra state government said it would introduce a controversial anti-superstition bill, according to reports.Dabholkar had received threats in the days before his murder, his son, Hamid, told NDTV. Sadhana often published articles on sensitive issues, including the creation of a separate Telangana state, student suicides, farmer suicides, slums, and the ideology behind India’s Naxalite movement.Dabholkar had also founded the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (Committee for Eradication of Blind Faith), a group that encouraged social reform in India.Maharashtra Home Minister R. R. Patil said on August 23, 2013, that police were investigating the murder.Also in August 2013, Pune police arrested two alleged arms dealers, Manish Nagori and Vilas Khandelwal, on charges of extortion, reports said. The pair, who were later named as suspects in the journalist’s murder, were released on bail because of a lack of evidence, police said, according to reports. Because the men face charges in other cases, they remain in jail. Both have denied any role in the murder, and Nagori said that investigating authorities offered him money to accept involvement in the murder, reports said. Authorities denied the allegation.In May 2014 the Maharashtra state government handed the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Investigations were delayed for a year because of staff shortages at the agency, according to reports. In July and August 2015, the bureau wrote to the state government to request that more officers be assigned to the case, The Hindu reported.In July 2015, relatives of Dabholkar filed a writ petition at the Bombay High Court seeking court monitoring of the investigation, according to reports. In December 2015, the Central Bureau of Investigation informed the Bombay High Court that it had identified two suspects and handed the names to the court, reports said. The names were kept confidential, The Hindu reported.In 2016, the bureau questioned several members of the hard-line Hindu group Sanatan Sanstha, which is believed to be behind the killing. The Sanatan Sanstha denies any role in the murder, reports said. Forensic analysis of the bullet cartridges found at the scene of Dabholkar’s killing and that of writers Govind Pansare and MM Kalburgi suggest a common set of killers, reports said.  ",

Nepal’s Maoist rebels, who have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1996 to overthrow the country’s constitutional monarchy, control portions of the country, including much of Kalikot and neighboring districts.

Rebels had gouged out his eyes, cut his hands and legs, and shot him in the chest, police told the NHRC team. Sharma, who lived in the village of Sipkhana, which is adjacent to Syuna, was known as an independent journalist.

However, the choreography of the bombing seemed certain to endanger journalists. Shortly after noon on Thursday, August 10, a grenade was thrown toward the entrance of the State Bank of India, near Residency Road in central Srinagar. This initial blast lured journalists and security forces to the area and was followed about 15 minutes later by the detonation of a powerful car bomb within a few feet of the crowd. Bhatia, 31, died of shrapnel wounds to his heart, according to the Indian newspaper The Asian Age.

In its decision, the court said that the main evidence against him was two letters written by Mishra, in which the journalist said he feared Banerjee would kill him. The judges said this was insufficient evidence, adding, “Merely because certain apprehension is made, it cannot be a material for assuming that the appellant has convicted the offence.”In April 2016, Banerjee told CPJ that his conviction was suspended and he had been granted bail. “I was in my office at that time [when Mishra was killed], yet I was convicted,” he said. His co-accused, Tripathi, was acquitted, he said. Banerjee said he was confident he would also be acquitted because a doctor’s report allegedly said that Mishra was drunk at the time. CPJ was unable to verify his claims. ",

Poh Si Teng, a former freelance journalist for Global Post, told CPJ that in the past Verma had also worked as a fixer for the Global Post.Indian officials said at the time that they had not been able to identify the perpetrator and that they were investigating the fatality.The clashes erupted following police dispersal of a meeting by Hindu farmers calling for justice in the killings of two Hindu men, according to The New York Times. The victims were believed to have been killed by Muslims, news reports said. Officials said the clashes were also fueled by a false video circulated last week that purportedly showed the two men being lynched. At least 28 people were killed and more than 90 individuals arrested in the violence.Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh met with Verma’s family and told them the culprits would be held responsible.

On November 30, Uttar Pradesh police identified and arrested three suspects in connection to the alleged arson, one of them the son of a local village head, but had not filed charges in the case as of early December, reports said.In a press conference on November 30, Balrampur Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma said that the son of the village head was allegedly motivated to kill the journalist because of his critical reporting on the village head ahead in a local election. Local news reports quoted Verma saying that the son of the village head, Singh, and Pintu Sahu, the journalist’s friend, were drinking alcohol at Singh’s home on the day of the attack. During that meeting, the son of the village head tried to convince Singh to stop writing negative reports about his mother, Verma told Indian Express.According to reports, the journalist and Sahu fell asleep, and the son of the village head called two individuals, one a pyrotechnic expert, to allegedly help him set the home on fire using alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Siddharth Kalhans, secretary of the Indian Federation of Working Journalists, told CPJ via phone that the alleged assailants locked the door of the room from the outside as Singh and Sahu tried to escape. According to broadcaster NDTV, Sahu died on the way to a local hospital, while Singh was rushed to a hospital in Lucknow, west of Balrampur, where he later died. Kalhans said he believes that the attack was retaliation for the journalist’s reporting on the village head’s family, though did not point to a specific article. According to Newslaundry and Kalhans, Singh had informed the local authorities about a possible threat to his life over his reporting, but the police did not take action. According to Indian Express, one of two alleged assailants who helped the village head’s son had an “old enmity” with the journalist, which escalated into an argument last year that was resolved by local police. The report did not provide further details on the incident. CPJ emailed the Balrampur police for comment but did not receive a response.  ",

Chaterpatti was taken to an area hospital but was later transferred to the Apollo Hospital in New Delhi. Police arrested three suspects, including the alleged gunman and a leader of the Sirsa-based religious sect Dera Sacha Sauda, according to the Press Trust of India news agency. Officials said that Dera Sacha Sauda members are believed to have ordered Chaterpatti’s murder in reprisal for the journalist’s reporting on sexual abuse and other crimes allegedly committed at the group’s compound in Sirsa. A delegation of journalists, including the president of the regional journalists’ group Haryana Patrakar Sangh and representatives of India’s National Union of Journalists, met with the director general of police in Haryana on the day of Chatterpatti’s death, November 21, to press authorities to bring the journalist’s killers to justice. The delegation also complained that several journalists in the area have received death threats for reporting on the activities of Dera Sacha Sauda.On January 17, 2019, a special court in Haryana convicted Gurmeet Ram Rahim, Kuldeep Singh, Nirmal Singh, and Krishan Lal of Chaterpatti’s murder and of criminal conspiracy.

He sustained severe head and neck injuries, and died as he was being transported to a local hospital, reports said.Reddy possessed a deep understanding of local issues and problems, and was considered a veteran journalist by his colleagues, news accounts said. He covered local issues such as health, education, water supply, food distribution, and corruption, and often criticized the government, Maoist insurgents, security forces, and local police, The Hindu said, citing journalists who knew him.Police said they believed Reddy was attacked by a group of Maoist insurgents with sharp weapons, news accounts reported. In the days following Reddy’s murder, Maoists claimed responsibility, according to news reports. In their statement, the Maoists accused Reddy of being a police informer, but did not substantiate their claims.In recent years, Reddy had been threatened by Maoists and his house was set on fire, which forced him to flee to a neighboring state, according to The Times of India. He was allowed to return home after issuing an apology to the Maoists, the report said. Reddy had also been harassed by the police around the same time, according to news reports. In March 2008, he was arrested and accused of being linked to the Maoists. He denied the allegations and was later released on bail.Four months after the murder, the highest decision-making body of the Maoist party released a statement about the killing. In an April 2014 press statement, the body said there was a “misunderstanding” between members and the party leadership, which led to the killing. The statement by the party said that a decision was taken to kill Sai Reddy for his “anti-people” writing. When police arrested Reddy in 2008 on suspicion of being a Maoist, the party changed its perception of him. This was not conveyed to local members, who killed him, the statement said. No one has been brought to justice in the case. Journalists in Chhattisgarh are often caught in the tension between Maoists and police and security forces, CPJ research shows. Maoists have led an insurgency in the central tribal areas of India for more than four decades. ",

His friends said the body showed signs of torturearound the face and neck. He had told colleagues that he had been receivingthreats from intelligence officials in recent months.Shahzad was reported missing after he failed to show up fora televised panel discussion in Islamabad. He was scheduled to discuss hisrecent article for Asia Times Online in which he reported that Al-Qaeda, havinginfiltrated the Pakistani Navy, was behind a 17-hour siege at a naval base inKarachi on May 22. He said the attack came after military or security officialsrefused to release a group of naval officials suspected of being linked tomilitant groups. The attack, coming soon after the U.S. killing of Osama binLaden on May 2, was deeply embarrassing to the Pakistani military. Earlier inMay, three navy buses carrying recruits were blown up via remote controldevices in Karachi, the large port city where the navy has its headquarters. Shahzad’s death also came a few days after the release ofhis book, Inside the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. For months, the journalist had been telling friends that hehad been warned by intelligence agents to stop reporting on sensitive securitymatters. In October 2010, Shahzad told Ali Dayan Hasan, a researcher for HumanRights Watch in Pakistan, that he had been threatened by a top official at ameeting at the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate inRawalpindi. Hasan said Shahzad sent him a note describing the meeting“in case something happens to me or my family in the future,” Human RightsWatch reported. Hameed Haroon, president of the All Pakistan Newspapers Societyand a former employer of Shahzad, said he had received a similar message atabout the same time. In July 2011, The New York Times reported that U.S.officials had reliable intelligence that showed that the ISI was responsiblefor Shahzad’s murder. Pakistan’s official commission of inquiry concluded inJanuary 2012 that the perpetrators were unknown, a finding that was widelycriticized as lacking credibility. ",

He was driving on his motorbike to a government event when a truck veered into him and ran him over, according to the channel’s bureau chief, Vikas Purohit, who witnessed the collision, and a report by NDTV. Purohit told CPJ that he took Sharma to the local hospital where the journalist was declared dead from injuries sustained in the crash.Purohit said both he and Sharma began receiving death threats last year after publishing two stories in July and October 2017 on alleged police corruption and illegal sand mining. The journalists shot a video that showed how a senior police officer accepted a bribe to allow the movement of vehicles carrying illegally mined sand, according to a report in the Indian Express newspaper. With strong demand for construction in India, illegal sand mining has increasingly become a problem because sand is difficult to transport and &#34;regulatory consequences are minimal&#34; for extracting it from off-limits areas, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.Purohit said local residents came to him and Sharma and said they would “crush them under a truck” for doing the stories. The villagers would also pass by the house when the journalists were home to intimidate them, Purohit said.Prashant Khare, the Bhind police superintendent, told CPJ that police were examining CCTV footage and that they had arrested the truck driver who hit Sharma. “A special investigation team has been formed to investigate whether this was an accident or it was a murder,” Khare said. Purohit told CPJ that about 10 days after News World aired Sharma’s October investigation, the journalist was &#34;beaten up by a bunch of goons but was saved thanks to the presence of police.&#34; He said the thugs they didn’t specifically mention the report. According to Purohit, Sharma filed a formal complaint to the police about the beating, but they did not take further action. The News World bureau chief also said that he and Sharma wrote letters to government authorities, including the state’s inspector general of police, to ask for government protection after they began receiving death threats, but they received no response.Khare confirmed that police received letters from Purohit and Sharma in December complaining about the threats. He said he had no knowledge of Sharma being beaten up.&#34;[T]he deputy superintendent of police conducted an inquiry and found that there was no threat to their lives,&#34; Khare told CPJ.Shivraj Singh Chouhan, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state, recommended an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), according to government officials who were quoted by the Hindustan Times newspaper. CBI spokesperson RK Gaur told CPJ that the agency has not received instructions from the federal government to investigate the case.  ",

At around midnight on October 20, three men went to Soomro’s home and tried to abduct him, according to his younger brother Aziz, who witnessed the crime. When Soomro resisted, the men shot him dead. Kawish editor Ali Kazi said that Soomro had at least nine bullet wounds and died almost instantly. The gunmen escaped with two accomplices in a white car waiting outside Soomro’s house, said local news reports. Aziz filed a case with police identifying three of the assailants by name, Wahid Ali Bijarani, Mohammad Ali Bijarani, and Mohammad Siddiq. Wahid Ali and Mohammad Ali, who are brothers, are members of the powerful Bijarani family, which owns much land in the area around Kandhkot and exercises considerable influence through the feudal system still prevalent in much of Pakistan. A third brother, Mir Mehboob Bijarani, was elected to the Sindh Provincial Assembly in the October 10 poll, while an uncle, Mir Hazzar Khan Bijarani, won a seat in the National Assembly. (Both represent exiled former prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s Pakistan People’s Party.) Soomro’s colleagues suspect that he was killed for his reporting about alleged abuses committed by Bijarani family members and supporters during the general elections. Soomro had a reputation for courageous, independent reporting, and his publication, Kawish, is one of the most influential newspapers in Sindh Province. On October 24, 2002, police announced that Wahid Ali Bijarani, Mohammad Ali Bijarani, and Mohammad Siddiq, the three suspects identified by the journalist’s family, had been detained for questioning. At year’s end, the three men remained in custody but had not been charged. The Bijarani family did not comment publicly on the allegations. ",

Police opened an investigation into the killing, according to those reports.A local police official told Al-Jazeera that the explosion appeared to have been caused by a magnetic device attached underneath Zehri’s driver’s seat; however, Dawn reported that security footage showed that the car was hit by a roadside bomb. Both reports state that the killing appeared to be a targeted attack.A representative of Metro 1 News told CPJ in a phone interview that Zehri covered general news and politics in Baluchistan province and did not engage in investigative reporting. The representative said that he did not know of a particular report by Zehri that could have led to the attack.CPJ emailed Tariq Ilahi, senior superintendent of the Lasbela district police, for comment, but did not receive any reply.

He suffered injuries to the head and abdomen, according to a report on the Free Press Kashmir news website. Two police officers, who had been assigned to protect him after an attack in 2000, were also fired at, the reports said. All three were rushed to the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital where they died, according to news reports. The Rising Kashmir office is located in Srinagar city’s Press Colony, a high-security zone that houses other media organizations, according to a report in The Telegraph newspaper. On June 15, police released images of three suspects on a motorcycle captured on closed-circuit TV, according to a report on the NDTV 24X7 news channel. SP Pani, the inspector general of the Jammu and Kashmir state police, told CPJ that Zubair Qadri, a fourth suspect, had been arrested on June 15 and a pistol was recovered from the scene of the crime. Footage showed him stealing a pistol from one of the slain security officers, according to a report on The Wire news website. When asked if any organization had claimed responsibility, Pani said that the killing was being treated as a &#34;terrorism-related&#34; crime and did not elaborate. When asked about the number of gunmen who killed Bukhari, Pani said this was &#34;a matter of investigation.” Amarjit Singh Dulat, a former director of Research and Analysis Wing, India’s external intelligence agency, claimed that Bukhari had approached Mehbooba Mufti, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, for “increased security” a few days before his death, according to news reports. Naeem Akhtar, a minister in the Jammu and Kashmir state government, did not take calls from CPJ seeking comment. Pani denied knowledge of the statement made by Dulat.Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, militant organizations that have been accused of violence in the state in the past, blamed Indian agencies for the killing and called it a “conspiracy to suppress the voices of an indigenous freedom struggle,” according to media reports. Jitendra Singh, a junior minister in the Indian prime minister’s office, in the Hindustan Times blamed “Pakistan-sponsored agencies” and said Bukhari was killed because he “tried to find a middle path.” Singh provided no evidence to link the killing to any Pakistan-associated group.In May this year, Bukhari had written a piece for the Scroll.in news website, in which he welcomed the Indian government’s decision to suspend military operations against alleged terrorists during the month of Ramadan in Kashmir. He said the ceasefire “offered a glimmer of hope to the common people.” Manoj Joshi, a political commentator, wrote on The Wire that his killing was aimed at disrupting any move toward establishing peace in the state.Between 1997 and 2012, Bukhari was the state bureau chief for The Hindu newspaper, before he started Rising Kashmir, according to a report in the paper. Colleagues and friends described him as someone who had moderate and nuanced views about the conflict-ridden situation in Kashmir. Siddharth Varadarajan, founding editor of The Wire, told CPJ that “he was the most sober, reliable, cautious, and objective of all national correspondents who were reporting Kashmir.”“He took on everyone: the violent militants who promote separatism and the Indian and Pakistani armies that shell each other from the swaths of the province they both occupy,” wrote journalist Sameer Yasir wrote in The New York Times.

Police suspect that the assailants belonged to the outlawed Biplobi Communist Party, one of several guerrilla groups active in the lawless southwest of the country. Hossain was last seen alive on the banks of the Ghangrail River, according to the national English-language newspaper The Daily Star. Two villagers who were in the area at the time said that they heard shots fired. Although police could not confirm whether Hossain was murdered at the time, his colleagues and his family believe that he was killed. An investigation published in the Bangla-language daily Janakantha in January 2005 reported that on the day Hossain was abducted, he was forced onto a boat and shot. His body was dumped into the river and was never been found, the report said. Bangladesh’s southwestern Khulna District is a notoriously dangerous place for the press; underground political groups and criminal gangs routinely threaten, attack, and murder journalists in retaliation for their reporting. Between 2000 and 2005, seven journalists were murdered in the southwest. Hossain was initially placed on CPJ’s missing list based on information available at the time. His case was reclassified in March 2005 based on subsequent research. ",

Khattak told CPJ that two people listed in the report are Musarrat Iqbal’s sons. The Associated Press reported on October 17 that police identified Ali Sher and Himayun Iqbal, Musarrat Iqbal’s sons, as suspects. They are accused of ambushing Khan’s car and killing him, the report said. A Haripur police official said Khan was killed because of his reporting, according to The Associated Press. On October 24, 2018, police arrested Himayun Iqbal, who they said was trying to flee to Iran via the Chaman border, according to Samaa. Ali Sher had not been apprehended as of late 2018.

In mid-April, he wrote an article alleging that Khatak, a resident of the village of Shadi Large, Badin District, was involved in drug trafficking. On April 30, Khatak visited Khan’s home, also in Shadi Large, and threatened to kill him, according to the editor of Ummat. Khan, who had received many threats in the past and had been physically assaulted twice in the previous six months, ignored the warning and filed a story on Khatak’s alleged involvement with a local prostitute that ran in the May 2 edition of Ummat. Sometime before noon that day, Khatak and three companions stopped Khan after he left his home by motorcycle. “I told you I would kill you,” Khatak reportedly said before opening fire. As Khan lay dying from multiple gunshot wounds, Khatak and his accomplices fled the scene in a white car. About a 30 minuted after the killing, Khatak surrendered to police in the nearby village of Khoski, and the local press widely covered his confession. Police also suspected the involvement of the powerful Arbab family, which allegedly ran a prostitution ring out of Shadi Large that smuggled women from Punjab Province and sold them across the border in India. After Khan began covering this story, family members tried unsuccessfully to buy his silence. When Khan continued to write critical stories about the Arbabs, they filed a defamation case against him and his newspaper. ",

Abbas was shot in the head and chest, and died while being treated in a nearby hospital, according to news reports.The group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attack both on the police vehicle and on the Samaa TV van, according to news reports. Militants in Pakistan have repeatedly staged secondary attacks to target people rushing to the scene of a first attack. Such secondary attacks put journalists, who often cover the aftermath of bombings, at special risk.Police chief Muqaddas Haier told the English-language newspaper Dawn that police suspect that the gunmen, likely more than two people, attacked the police vehicle to attract the media’s attention. Police arrested some 30 suspects during raids across Karachi following the attack, according to press reports. Monetary rewards were offered for information leading to the capture of the perpetuators, according to Dawn. Officials from the highest level of the Pakistani government, including Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, condemned Khan’s murder and vowed to safeguard journalists.Khan had worked for Samaa TV for 18 months, and was the sole breadwinner in his family, according to Dawn.

Kanak TV and Sambad are owned by the Odisha-based Eastern Media group.Police said assailants had stabbed Acharya the night before in a desolate area of Khallikote town in Odisha as he was on his way home from work, according to those reports.Immediately following the murder, Kanak TV Editor-in-Chief Soumya Ranjan Patnaik told CPJ that he was not aware of any threats made against the journalist. Subsequent reports said Acharya had been threatened with death by the owner of a cashew processing plant in Khallikote, after the journalist published a report alleging child labor practices at the plant. The Hindu reported that the journalist was in possession of footage showing child laborers working under hazardous conditions.While some initial reports citing Acharya’s editor and police suggested the murder may have been related to a family dispute, authorities on June 8, 2014, arrested Shyam Sundar Prusty, the owner of the cashew processing plant, and an alleged accomplice, N Ramesh Reddy, owner of a local light and sound unit, in connection with the murder, news reports said.Police cited pre-existing personal enmity between Acharya and Prusty, but said that Prusty had seen Acharya’s reporting on child labor at his facility as an attempt to damage his business, according to Ashish Kumar Singh, police superintendent of Ganjam district, cited in The Indian Express. Singh accused Prusty of ordering Acharya’s murder, paying three friends 50,000 rupees (US$850), and providing them with three new SIM cards, according to reports.Police said Prusty confessed to the murder, according to local news reports from June 2014.In October 2014, police also arrested Sibaram Nayak, a journalist who works for the Odisha-based Eastern Media group, according to news reports. Police accused Nayak of speaking to Prusty on the phone before and after the murder, those reports said. Nayak was charged under sections 302 and 120(b) of the Indian Penal Code for murder and criminal conspiracy respectively, reports said. He denied any involvement in the murder, reports said.Nayak, Prusty, Reddy, and two more suspects, Suresh Chandra Sahu and Santosh Kumar Moharana, were charged with murder and on June 27, 2019, were convicted by a Khallikote court, according to various news reports. Prusty was named as the mastermind of the crime, and the others as accessories, according to those reports. The five were sentenced to life imprisonment.According to a June 27, 2019, press release by the Odisha Police, a sixth suspect, Nrusingha Panda, absconded and did not face trial. Satya Narayan Pradhan, inspector-in-charge of Khallikote police station, told CPJ over the phone in September 2020 that Panda had still not been located.Acharya is survived by his wife and daughter, according to reports.

Singh died of multiple stab wounds to the head and upper body while being transferred from a local hospital to a larger one later that evening.Local journalists said police ignored Singh’s profession as a possible motive for fear of political repercussions, and arrested five people, including her sister-in-law, for killing her over a property dispute.Property did play a role, according to a report compiled by press freedom groups that conducted an investigative mission to Nepal in February. Singh believed Maoists abducted and murdered her father and brother in 2005 and seized family land. But in her reporting, the press freedom groups found, she had defended all victims displaced in the conflict, and addressed sensitive issues including communal violence and women’s rights in print and on air.“There is no denying that [Singh] may have had a personal stake in the issue of land seizures, but her journalism was exercised in the larger public interest,” the report said. After consulting with police, family members, and colleagues, the groups concluded that although there were several overlapping motives and actors involved, her work was a major factor in her death.In June 2011, defendants Lalita Singh and Nemlal Paswan were each sentenced to life imprisonment in the killing, according to local news reports. Three others accused of carrying out the attack were acquitted. Police arrested Umesh Yadav, a former Maoist believed to be the mastermind behind Singh’s murder, in September 2013. In April 2015, a court in Dhanusha district convicted Yadav of ordering Singh’s murder and sentenced him to life in prison, according to local news reports and the Federation of Nepali Journalists.

At least two assailants intercepted the journalist’s car at 9:20 p.m. in Karachi’s Liaquatabad area, shooting him four times in the head and once in the neck, Geo TV Managing Director Azhar Abbas told CPJ. Witnesses said one assailant spoke to Babar briefly before opening fire, Abbas said.In April, police announced the arrests of five people and said additional suspects were at large. In all, police said, at least 17 men were involved in the murder plot. Police, based on statements given by the suspects, described a plot organized by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, or MQM, Pakistan’s third-largest political party and considered its most influential secular political organization. A Joint Investigation Team report said the killing had been ordered by Agha Murtaza, a South Africa-based MQM operative. Zulfikar Mirza, home minister of Sindh, was outspoken at the time in saying that MQM operatives were responsible for the killing.Local journalists believe the killing was prompted by Babar’s aggressive reporting on violent political turf wars, extortion, targeted killings, electricity theft, and land-grabbing.Just weeks after Babar was slain, several people connected to the investigation were murdered. They included a police informant, two police constables, and the brother of an investigating officer. One of the constables, Asif Rafiq, was on the scene when Babar was murdered and had identified the plotters’ vehicle. On November 10, 2012, two gunmen aboard a motorcycle killed Haidar Ali, the only remaining witness in the case, near his home in the Soldier Bazaar area of Karachi. He was due to testify in court two days later.The original prosecutors in the case—Muhammad Khan Buriro and Mobashir Mirza—told CPJ that they were threatened and eventually fired. They fled the country in late 2011.On March 3, 2014, more than three years after Babar was killed, a special Anti-Terrorism Court convicted six defendants for their roles in the murder. Judge Mushtaq Ahmed Leghari, who presided over the court, sentenced Naveed Polka, Muhammad Ali Rizvi, Faisal Mahmood, and Mohammad Shahrukh Khan to life in prison, news reports said. Two others, Kamran (alias &#34;Zeeshan&#34;) and Faisal Mota, who remained at large, were given the death sentence in absentia. A seventh man, Mohammed Shakeel, was acquitted for lack of evidence, the reports said.In an alleged video confession posted on YouTube, Khan said he had been told to follow Babar as he was driving home from work, according to a Reuters report. He said Zeeshan had stepped in front of the journalist’s car and shot him six to seven times. The video was authenticated to Reuters by the prosecutor, the report said.Police arrested Faisal Mota, said by the court to have masterminded the murder, in Karachi on March 11, 2015, according to reports. On August 16, 2017, the Sindh High Court ordered a retrial in his case the lower court, according to reports.On June 15, 2020, police arrested Zeeshan in Karachi, according to news reports. ",

The blogger, who was also identified in reports as Oyasiqur Rhaman, was pronounced dead upon arrival at a local hospital from injuries he sustained to his head, face, and neck, news reports said. Police were able to identify Rahman using a voter identity card they found in his possession, the reports said.Deputy Police Commissioner Biplob Kumar Sarker told Agence France-Presse that in initial interrogations the suspects said they killed Rahman “because he criticized hardline Islamists” in his writings. Rahman wrote about religion, science, and against communalism, mainly on Facebook, according to news website BDNews24. According to The Dhaka Tribune, Rahman opposed “irrational religious beliefs, superstitions, and radical Islamists” on his Facebook page. He had also written a 52-episode series for an anti-religion satirical site called Dhormockery.com, according to the London-based International Humanist and Ethical Union, reports said.Imran Sarker, head of the Blogger and Online Activists Network in Bangladesh, told AFP that Rahman used to write under the penname Kutshit Hasher Chhana (Ugly Duckling), and described him as a progressive thinker who was critical of religious fundamentalism.One of the assailants fled the scene, but the other two were immediately apprehended by bystanders. Police arrested the two men, both students at local madrasas, or theological schools, news reports said.In confessions to police, the two men said they didn’t know what a blog was, nor were they familiar with Rahman’s writing, but said they had orders to kill the blogger, reports said.Rahman had received numerous online threats including one that said “Get ready for the afterlife,” and another that said, “See you in hell,” according to reports.On July 20, 2016, a Dhaka court indicted five suspects, two of whom were not in custody, believed to be members of the banned militant group Ansarullah Bangla Team in the case, according to local news reports.

He had received and reported several death threats prior to his murder and complained on social media about lack of action from the police. In a past interview, Rasheed told The New York Times he had been targeted by radical groups because he spoke out against extremism. Rasheed also led the “Find Moyameeha” campaign for his friend and Minivan reporter Ahmed Rilwan Abdulla, who was abducted in 2014 and remains missing. In August 2017, police said that religious extremists had killed Rasheed. The same month, the state charged seven individuals in connection with the murder. Authorities charged Hussain Ziyad, Ismail Haisham Rasheed, Ismail Rasheed, Hassan Shifaz, Mohamed Dhifran, and Ahmed Zihan Ismail with first-degree murder, according to Raajje TV. A seventh suspect, Mohamed Yashfau Rasheed, was charged with aiding and abetting murder, according to the Maldives Independent. The hearings in the trial have been closed to the public at the prosecutor general’s request, Raajje TV reported. Under Maldives law, the prosecutor general can request secret proceedings “if they believe a circumstance that obstructs justice could arise in an open hearing,” according to the Maldives Independent. Rasheed’s family released a statement on April 25, 2017, requesting an independent investigation into their son’s death, citing lack of faith in achieving justice for their son.  “Having failed our son in life, we appeal to the police not to fail him in death,” Rasheed’s parents said in the statement.In early May, the family sued police for negligence, according to local reports.  In September, a civil court dismissed the lawsuit, and said that investigating police misconduct falls under the National Integrity Commission’s jurisdiction, according to the Maldives Independent. As of late 2017 the commission had not publicly issued a response. Maldives police did not respond to an email CPJ sent April 24, 2017.  ",

The 40-year-old journalist was the president and secretary-general of the Tribal Union of Journalists’ South Waziristan chapter and worked for the Urdu-language Daily Ummat and Daily Nai Baat newspapers. He was also district coordinator in Tank for the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent group critical of all sides in the ongoing conflict in Pakistan.In a statement, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan called on authorities to catch the killers and bring them to justice. The statement added: “In none of the five previous fatal casualties that [the commission] has suffered over the last few years have the authorities succeeded in catching the killers.” In an email, Zohra Yousuf, the commission’s chairperson, told CPJ that members of the commission who knew Mehsud had met to discuss his case. “The consensus is that he was killed because of his work as a journalist,” Yousuf said.The Taliban claimed responsibility for Mehsud’s killing, with its commander Qari Saif Ullah Saif telling Reuters: “We killed him because he was writing against us … we have some other journalists on our hit list in the region, soon we will target them.” It is difficult to verify such claims independently, but it follows a pattern of attacks on journalists and human rights workers in and around the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.Mehsud reported mainly from South Waziristan in Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, along the border with Afghanistan. Violence including targeted killings in the Tank district, which borders South Waziristan, is commonplace, according to reports. Because of constant threats stemming from conflicts between militant groups and the military, journalists covering the region often live outside its districts, CPJ has found.In a CPJ special report on Pakistan, published in 2009, journalists in the region said that militant groups often complain of what they consider unfair coverage of their activities by the media. The journalists with whom CPJ spoke said the press is often under pressure from the government to play down the militants’ activities.Based on the patterns of journalist killings over a protracted period, and the assessment by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, CPJ considers Mehsud as having been killed because of his work as a journalist.
