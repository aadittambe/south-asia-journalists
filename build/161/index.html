        <h4> What&apos;s Veeraboina Yadagiri&apos;s story?</h4>
            Yadagiri, a veteran journalist and staff correspondent for the local,Telugu-language daily Andhra Prabha, was stabbed to death nearhis home in the town of Medak, in India’s southern Andhra PradeshState. Local journalists told CPJ that Yadagiri, 35, was murderedin reprisal for his articles investigating the illegal sale of home-brewedliquor, known locally as toddy.Local sources told CPJ that Yadagiri had written a series of articlesdetailing the dangers of consuming toddy and accusing local politiciansof being involved in its trade. The national English-language newspaperThe Hindu reported that prior to his death, Yadagirihad registered a police complaint after he received threats from alocal contractor involved in the illegal toddy business.According to local sources, on the night of February 21, Yadagiriwas invited to a meeting with several people involved in the toddytrade. After the meeting, Yadagiri was accompanied home by at leastthree of the men who had been present, along with Siddaram Reddy,another local journalist and friend of Yadagiri. Lakshminarayana Goud,one of those accompanying Yadagiri, stabbed him multiple times beforefleeing the scene, according to local news reports and sources.Local police arrested four suspects and charged them with involvementin the murder. According to Amar Devulapalli, the head of the AndhraPradesh Union of Working Journalists (APUWJ), Goud was charged, alongwith Sirimalle Srinivas, Venkatesh Chauhan, and Nagi Reddy (who isnot related to Siddaram Reddy).Devulapalli told CPJ that the state government of Andhra Pradesh condemnedthe murder and gave money and land to Yadagiri’s family as compensationfor their loss. However, local police have accused Siddaram Reddyof being the true culprit in the murder and have arrested and chargedhim with involvement, Devulapalli said. APUWJ pressured the federal Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)to investigate the state’s prosecution of Yadagiri’s murder. The CBIbegan an inquiry into the handling of the case, postponing the trialsof all the defendants, Devulapalli said.
