        <h4> What&apos;s Mukarram Khan Aatif&apos;s story?</h4>
            Two gunmen killed Aatif, a reporter for the Pashto-languageservice of the U.S. government-funded Voice of America, at a mosque inShabqadar, north of Peshawar. The assailants, who struck during eveningprayers, shot Aatif multiple times before fleeing on motorcycles, police toldreporters. Aatif died of his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar. Animam was injured in the attack.Taliban spokesmen spoke to several news outlets, takingresponsibility for the killing. Ihsanullah Ihsan told The Associated Press thatAatif had been warned “a number of times to stop anti-Taliban reporting, but hedidn’t do so. He finally met his fate.”Several CPJ sources said they were skeptical Aatif had beenkilled on the orders of the Taliban or for the publicly stated reasons. Aatiftold friends and relatives that he started receiving threats from military andintelligence officials immediately after covering a November 2011 attack byU.S.-led NATO forces on Pakistani army check posts at Salala, near the borderwith Afghanistan. Twenty-four Pakistani soldiers died in the attack. Aatiffiled reports on the attack for Deewa Radio and took part in what are calledtwo-ways, which are live exchanges with the station’s studio journalists. Aatif had spoken to local residents who said a Talibanhideout was just two kilometers from the army check posts, a tribal areajournalist told CPJ. The Taliban’s proximity to the army posts was highlysensitive information because it could have provided justification for theAmerican attack. An official with the U.S. National Security Council told CPJthat a Special Forces team launched the attack after taking fire from the areaof the Pakistani check posts. Deewa Radio said Aatif’s reports explained the geography ofthe area but did not mention the Taliban. Deewa did not respond to CPJ’srepeated queries seeking information on what was said by the station’s studiojournalists during their live two-way exchanges with Aatif. Deewa said noarchive of Aatif’s reports was available. Multiple CPJ sources in Pakistan andthe United States said the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate was believedto be behind the murder. A Pakistani security official said the speculation wasunsubstantiated.
