            Devakumar, Jaffna correspondent for the independent channelNews 1st, was stabbed to death when he was attacked by supporters of theLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), according to Sunanda Deshapriya,spokesman for local press freedom group the Free Media Movement. Deshapriya said that FMM’s investigations had shown that Devakumar was killedby Tamil Tiger supporters in retribution for critical reporting on LTTE activitiesin the area. Deshapriya also noted the journalist had covered agovernment-sponsored rally that the LTTE had wanted him to avoid.The group also killed Mahendran Warden, a friend of thejournalist who was traveling with him by motorbike in the government-controlledarea, according to a report published on the News 1st Web site. Devakumar andWarden were returning home in the evening when the attack occurred, newsreports said. Warden was the son of a leading member of the Eelam People’sDemocratic Party, a Tamil party working with the government, Deshapriya said.Devakumar was one of the few remaining journalists reportingfrom the peninsula, a focal point in the civil war between the predominantlySinhalese government and the LTTE, which claims territory for an ethnic Tamilhomeland.
