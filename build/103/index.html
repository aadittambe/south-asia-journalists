        <h4> What&apos;s Parag Kumar Das&apos;s story?</h4>
            Das, editor-in-chief of the largest circulation daily in Assam, Asomiya Pratidin, was fatally shot in the state capital, Guwahati, as he was picking up his 7-year-old son from school. He was the leading journalistic voice for self-rule for Assam and had continued covering separatist perspectives despite arrests in 1992 and 1993. A monitor of human rights, he also published a newsletter that reported on army and counterinsurgency abuses against the Assamese. Colleagues believe his recent interview with the leader of the separatist United Liberation Front of Assam triggered his assassination by a splinter group.
