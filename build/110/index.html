            Sathiyamoorthy, a supporter of the secessionist LiberationTigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), wrote for many pro-Tamil publications andfrequently contributed to official LTTE media. His live commentaries fromconflict zones were widely seen and heard on pro-Tamil television and radiobroadcasts. According to independent Tamil news sources as well as the LTTE, hewas killed in a Sri Lankan artillery barrage in the Mullaitheevu district.Colleagues outside of the conflict area, not all of themTamils, said Sathiyamoorthy’s reports and commentaries were measured, and thathe strove to maintain journalistic standards and an accurate representation ofthe wartime situations in which he found himself. His work had global impact, reaching largenumbers of Tamils living overseas.Born in 1972, he eventually moved to Jaffna but traveled throughout the areascontrolled by the LTTE during the conflict. He was married and was the fatherof a 6-year-old girl.Several Tamil media reports said Sathiyamoorthy did not dieimmediately. They cited relatives who said a lack of proper medicalattention contributed to his death.
