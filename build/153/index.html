In his complaint, which was addressed to the Prayagraj zone additional director general of police, Srivastava claimed that he was being followed and that he had heard from his sources that the criminal group was planning to harm him for his reporting, according to those reports.Renuka Srivastava, the journalist’s wife, also said that he had received threats in the days leading to his death, according to reports.
