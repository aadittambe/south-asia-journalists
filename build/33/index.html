            Rokka Magar, a newsreader for the Kham Magar­language service of RadioNepal, was abducted by Maoist rebels on August 1, 2002, while travelingby bus to the town of Surkhet, where he worked. Rebels intercepted thebus near Jaluki, a Maoist-controlled village near the borders ofWestern Rolpa and Pyuthan districts, and kidnapped several passengers,including Rokka Magar and a representative from the British charityGurkha Welfare Trust.It was not clear why the Maoists targeted certain passengers, butrebels generally view journalists working for state-run Radio Nepal asgovernment agents.In October 2004, rebels informed Rokka Magar’s wife, Dil Kumari, thathe had been taken to Khawang, a forested area between Rukum and Rolpain midwestern Nepal, and killed in January 2003 on suspicion of spyingfor the government, according to local news reports.The news was first reported in the Nepalese media in March 2005. RokkaMagar had been on CPJ’s missing list, but his case was reclassifiedbased on the new reports. The journalist’s body has not been found.
