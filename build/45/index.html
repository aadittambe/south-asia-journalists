            Lone, a newspaper salesman and freelance journalist who contributed to several publications, including the English-language Greater Kashmir, was killed by a group of masked gunmen who also fatally shot his seven-year-old son in their home in Kangan, Kashmir. Lone had reportedly received death threats from a security agent for his coverage of troop movements in Kashmir. Srinagar police attributed the killing to Kashmiri separatists.
