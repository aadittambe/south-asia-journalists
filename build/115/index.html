Local journalists criticized the minister for what they perceive as a lack of security for journalists working in the minister’s own district.In the weeks surrounding Sharma’s murder, journalists reported several cases of their colleagues, who covered politics, business, and corruption, being beaten or threatened by local politicians and criminals, according to The Wall Street Journal.
