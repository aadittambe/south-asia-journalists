Police reports said Qureshi’s throat hadbeen cut and described his body as showing signs of torture, The ExpressTribune said.Another brother, Shahid, who lives in London, told CPJ thatthe killers had taken the journalist’s laptop and telephone. Shahid Qureshi,who also wrote for The London Post website, told CPJ that he and his brotherhad received death threats from men who claimed they were from the MuttahidaQaumi Movement, or MQM.

An investigativedocumentary produced by Samaa TV raised numerous questions about the policeinvestigation and cast doubt on the allegations against Hameed.
