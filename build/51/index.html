        <h4> What&apos;s Hayatullah Khan&apos;s story?</h4>
            Khan’s body was found by villagers in the North Waziristantown of Miran Shah, where he had been kidnapped six months earlier. Khan wasabducted on December 5, 2005, by five gunmen who ran his car off the road ashis younger brother, Haseenullah, watched helplessly. Local governmentofficials and family members said Khan, 32, had been found handcuffed and shotseveral times. His body appeared frail and he had grown a long beard since hewas last seen, Pakistani journalists told CPJ.The day before his abduction, Khan photographed whatapparently were the remnants of a U.S.-made missile said to have struck a housein Miran Shah on December 1, 2005, killing senior Al-Qaeda figure Hamza Rabia.The pictures, widely distributed by the European Pressphoto Agency on the daythey were shot, contradicted the Pakistani government’s explanation that Rabiahad died in a blast caused by explosives within the house. International news mediaidentified the fragments in the photographs as part of a Hellfire missile,possibly fired from a U.S. drone.Khan, who was also a reporter for the Urdu-language dailyAusaf, had received numerous threats from Pakistani security forces, Talibanmembers, and local tribesmen because of his reporting.During Khan’s six-month disappearance, government officialsprovided his family with numerous and often contradictory accounts of hiswhereabouts: Khan was in government custody, soon to be released; Khan had beenabducted by  “miscreants”;  he had been taken by Waziristan mujahideen;he had been flown to the military base at Rawalpindi and was then detained inKohat air base.Khan’s relatives were told by hospital workers that he hadfive or six bullet wounds and that one hand had been manacled in handcuffstypically used by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate. MahmudAli Durrani, Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, dismissed the reportedpresence of the handcuffs as circumstantial and said the cuffs could have beenplanted to incriminate the government. No autopsy was performed.An investigation led by High Court Justice Mohammed RezaKhan was conducted, but the results were not made public. Hayatullah Khan’sfamily said they were not interviewed by the judge or other investigators.North West Frontier Gov. Ali Mohammad Jan Orakzai told CPJ that NorthWaziristan was not secure enough to risk exposing a judicial figure tokidnapping or death. CPJ has repeatedly sought the release of the report,making a direct request to President Asif Ali Zardari in 2011. The reportremained a secret as of February 2013.In November 2007, Khan’s widow was killed in a bomb that wasdetonated outside her home.
