This is my first news applications developed after completing the First News App tutorial. I wrote a web scraper to collect data from the Committee to Protect Journalists website to obtain biographical descriptions of each journalist's death. Using the GeoPy package, I converted locations to geographical coordinates â€” after cleaning and analyzing the data in pandas.

The app can be viewed [here](https://aadittambe.github.io/south-asia-journalists/build/index.html). The scraping script and data analysis can be viewed [here](https://github.com/aadittambe/app/blob/master/analysis/scraper.ipynb).
