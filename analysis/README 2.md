This is my first news application developed after completing the [First News App tutorial](https://first-news-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). 

I wrote a web scraper to collect data from the Committee to Protect Journalists website to obtain biographical descriptions of each journalist's death. Using the GeoPy package, I converted locations to geographical coordinates â€” after cleaning and analyzing the data in pandas.

My analysis can be found in [this](https://github.com/aadittambe/jour-analysis/blob/main/scraper.ipynb) jupyter notebook, while the app can be viewed [here](https://aadittambe.github.io/app/build/index.html).
